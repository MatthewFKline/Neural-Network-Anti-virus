# Neural-Network-Antivirus

The next step I took in experimenting with AV and machine learning, following the KNN model, was building a neural network.

Based on TensorFlow's binary classification tutorial.

Not fully functional - Still refining the creation of a model before adding functionality for analyzing specific files with existing model.

Current model accuracy is very low.  Will attempt to improve by tinkering with layers.
